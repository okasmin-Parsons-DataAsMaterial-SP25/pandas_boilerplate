# pandas boilerplate & intro

This repository includes a devcontainer for a python jupyter notebook to be run in github codespaces (without installing anything locally).

The jupyter notebook includes an introduction to pandas with example data. A simple matplotlib chart is also demoed at the end.

Feel free to use this as an introductory reference or fork the code and replace the cells with your own data as a starting point for your project.
